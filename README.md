Openwrt wifi clients dashboard

I'm working on a centralized wireless clients dashboard page. The controller should be any openwrt device, while the other ap's from your network will pass data to the controller.
Future steps:
- convert to C
- push configs to slave ap's ( i personaly need vlans management from a single point and wifi configs for the moment)
- push 802.11kv data to slave ap's 
- device adoption like on Ubiquity, TPlink, Grandstream
