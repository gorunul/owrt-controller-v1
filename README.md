Openwrt wifi clients dashboard

I'm working on a centralized wireless clients dashboard page. The controller will be any openwrt device, while the other ap's from your network will pass data to the controller.
Future steps:
- convert to C
- central device management featuring backups and limited configs ( i personaly need vlans management from a single point and wifi configs)
- device adoption like on Ubiquity, TPlink, Grandstream
